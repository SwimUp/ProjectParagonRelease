Modding tool for automatically patching.


[h1]Overview[/h1]
Automatic patching is defined via a PatchTree and various PatchNodes, containing the logic of the patchs and instructions respectively. Pre-made nodes:
[list]
[*] List all Defs and Drivers.
[*] Type searcher: search in all methods for calls to DefOfs.
[*] Toil searcher: search in all methods for called actions.
[*] Patch Defs and Types: from simple stat replacing (accessible entirely via XML) to user-defined Harmony patches.
[*] Patch Toils: patch any particular Toil, and insert Toils in arbitrary positions.
[*] Stat-Injector: Uses [b]MathParser.org[/b] formula structure to inject stats to ThingDefs. (accessible entirely via XML)
[/list]
Check [b][LC]ToolsFramework[/b] for an example implementation.
