&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

This mod adds no weapons, only the workbenches and research projects used to create ones from other modules. Check them out in the collections above.

Supports working multi-caliber firearms, alternate firing modes, and underbarrel weapons (grenade launchers, breaching shotguns, etc) where applicable, thanks to Vanilla Expanded Framework's MVCF functions.

Combat Extended support - Adds dozens of new calibers and cartridges from all over history. It also makes minor changes to the ammunition sets for a few existing types (namely allowing real life inter-compatible cartridges to be used in the same weapons; 7.62x25mm Tokarev guns can now use 7.63x25mm Mauser, .460 SW can now use .454 Casull, .45 Schofield, etc.)
