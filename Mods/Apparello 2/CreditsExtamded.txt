Because nothing ever gets properly done entirely alone, I'd like to give the hugest thanks to following peoples
For general help or other efforts,
Skullywag (A mighty dillweed like no other but I like having him around)
Latta (Translations! also having a name just one letter away from being milked coffee, which amuses me to no end)
Skyarkhangel (Also translations and for the mental image of flying shark angel)
Viperlol (Made such magnificent job with gasmasks that I've out of spite misplaced somewhere and aren't currently even included in the mod)
SuperiorX (for absolutely superb testing)
Igabod (lots of xml fiddling help regarding stats and stuff)

And for providing bits of inspiration!
Buccee (Indirectly solved the case of mysteriously spawning pants and also indirectly making boots and gloves a thing)
Also thanks to numerous people who then made me realize how annoying the endless flood of boots and gloves actually were
Spoonshortage (Caused a few imfs and mimfs. But mostly for putting my name in the FashionRIMsta thread with cat sized letters thankyouverymuch)
NoImageAvailable (Never ceased to bug me about the long coat until it was finally done!)
Bog (Very moist. Also Poncho)

Special mentions for the sake of flattery
Tynan for adding hats in A6
Chiko, XanderDox for practically getting me into modding in the first place
Mrofa for being likely the only person who liked my washing machine
Superpirson for making that trap mod and supplying me code to have lots and lots of my hats to protect against his gas traps, oh boy!
Itchyflea for being a cat
Minami26 for being four cats in one
Telkir, not a cat (?), but I wouldn't put that past him.
Creators of FashionRIMsta for finally getting up another apparel mod for rimworld! (also possibly cats.)

And finally you, dear player and user of my mod. I have recieved a lot of love from quite a bunch of you and surprisingly little hate (it's up to you to change that!)
