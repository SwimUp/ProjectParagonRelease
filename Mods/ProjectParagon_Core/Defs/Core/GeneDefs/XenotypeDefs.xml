    <description>The path of the formation of the rudiments of the mind in these mobile plants was quite long and difficult. Having originated on a distant planet as a common plant, this species has been able to obtain a number of evolutionary advantages. The rudiments of the motor system appeared, which was controlled by the nerve centers based on the position of the sun and nutrients, which allowed the first Treants to randomly move around the planet's surface. The further path to predation was paved after an unknown disaster that led to climate change. The Treants were forced to switch to the absorption of insects through new parts of their body. The consumption of large amounts of protein has led to the development of the rudiments of the brain and spinal cord. These circumstances allowed the Treants to move to a completely new stage in their development. After a while, the Treants were spotted by a group of humans who arrived on the planet for colonization. It was they who later paved the way for the Treants to settle new planets. At present, the Treants' intelligence is not high. They are capable of producing tools, have tactics and the ability to communicate. The race has learned to do without a light source for a long time, but prefers to be in the open air.</description>

    <label>Aeron</label>
    <description>A huge anthropomorphic crustacean with the complex brain structure of a sentient species. The species originated as a result of an undocumented event that led to the radioactive contamination of a large area of ​​​​the planet. Aerons quickly evolved under the influence of mutagens and acquired a modern look. They lost most of their limbs, moving upright, and also switched to an omnivorous diet.</description>

    <label>Arachnid</label>
    <description>Arachnids were created as a labor force for mining on planets with low water content. They are resistant to temperature extremes and are capable of hibernation in the absence of food. In view of the inherent weak intellect, they were not capable of independent development and carried out the programmed program of their existence. Project managers were forced to abandon the use of the view due to low efficiency. The individuals remaining on the surface of the planets continued to exist and began to progress. In the end, they gained consciousness and began to form societies resembling human ones.</description>

They have concomitant features such as horns and hooves, but the hands have a human-like structure that allows Taurus to use objects of labor and weapons. In general, the level of their development is at the medieval level. They prefer to raid nearby settlements of other factions instead of a sedentary lifestyle.</description>
