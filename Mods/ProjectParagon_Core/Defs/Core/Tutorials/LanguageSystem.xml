All factions in the game have their own language. Its knowledge is necessary for interaction with the settlements of the faction and trade.

You can find out which language a particular faction has, as well as the progress of researching a given language, in the factions tab.

The language is divided into several subcategories
- Gestures
- Speech
- Writing

Each aspect of the speech opens up several possibilities for interacting with the faction. If you don't know some part of the language, you won't be able to recruit pawns of that faction, you won't be able to trade with that faction, etc.

The language can be learned through the purchase of language books and scrolls. The complexity of different aspects of a language varies from language to language.
