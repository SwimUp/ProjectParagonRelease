		<text>
Paragon contains a universal terraforming system, which is quite convenient to use.

Do you need fertile soil? Just install the project (Projects -> Terraforming), the system will automatically calculate the cost. All that remains is to supply the materials and complete the construction.

Different types of soil contain materials on their surface that can be excavated. After complete excavation, only excavated soil will remain in place, on which it is impossible to build.
In this way you can extract earth, slag, sand and other materials (Projects -> Terraforming).
