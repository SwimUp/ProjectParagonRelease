Steam energy is the first phase of energy development in our modpack.

Steam structures follow a modular principle. So, to produce steam, a steam generator must be connected to boilers that produce heat, as well as to barrels of water.
The type of fuel for boilers affects the efficiency of the generator.

The resulting steam can be used in steam engines or engines to produce electricity.

They must be attached close to the steam generator, according to the diagram.

There are several stages in the development of steam generators, which make it possible to support the simultaneous operation of several machines at once.
