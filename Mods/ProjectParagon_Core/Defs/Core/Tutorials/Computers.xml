New calculations can no longer be carried out using the ordinary human mind. You need something larger that performs tens, hundreds, or even millions of calculations per second.


So, some technologies will require calculations, which are divided into 2 conventional types - computing power and RAM.

Computing power determines the speed of technology research. Even if you don't have enough power, you will be able to research the technology with a large penalty.

RAM is a certain obligatory quantity, without which research simply cannot be carried out.


At first, only huge and inefficient giants will be available to you - tube computers. They heat up the room and take up a lot of space.

Over time, you will discover the first composite computers, which are much more efficient and smaller than their ancestors.
Their main difference is the ability to assemble various assembly options, which allows you to easily adapt to new requirements.
