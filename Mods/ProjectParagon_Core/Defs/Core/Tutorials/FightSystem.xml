- Weapon handling skills
Using this or that weapon, you will improve your possession of it. As you can see, the system is also similar to the vanilla skill system.
A pawn can have a different interest, which affects the pumping speed. In addition, there are three subcategories at once. Using the gladius, you will also upgrade short swords and swords, respectively.
This gives more specialization to your pawns. You can change weapons at any time, but you will be forced to upgrade your possession again. At the same time, changing weapons to a related type will save you some of the bonuses.

- Fighting styles
Style is a kind of stance that you can toggle in the pawn menu. Often, a style unlocks special skills for you, but it can also be passive bonuses for carrying a particular weapon.
Switching the combat stance is carried out with the button when choosing a settler.

- Combat backstories
These are the generated traits of your colonists. They can give you experience for a particular weapon.

- Learned skills
These are traits that grant access to certain active abilities, such as meteorology, or give passive bonuses to professions.

- Automatic battle
Without any settings, your pawns will use random skills if they have enough strength. You can also customize the combat pattern to only use what you see fit.
