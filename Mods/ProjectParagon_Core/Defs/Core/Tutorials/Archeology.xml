Paragon features an archeology system, thanks to which you can receive culture points and unique artifacts (ancient skeletons, artifacts).

First you need to build:
{Hyperlink(def="ArcheologyTable", defType="ThingDef")}

Using this table, you can put together “puzzles” from bones to eventually get an artifact.
{Image(path="Core/Tutorials/Archeology/1", size="(510, 320)", expand="true", expandSizeMult="1.8")}

But how do you get these fragments?
To do this you need to carry out excavations. In the first stages, you will have to choose a place at random.
{Hyperlink(def="ArcheologyPlace", defType="ThingDef")}


In the future, it will be possible to conduct precise analysis using scanning, as well as use autonomous mining tools:
{Hyperlink(def="SeismicScanner", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="ArcheologyDrill", defType="ThingDef")}
{Image(path="Core/Tutorials/Archeology/2", size="(510, 514)")}
