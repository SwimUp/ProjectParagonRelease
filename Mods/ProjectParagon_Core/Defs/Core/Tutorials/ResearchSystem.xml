In the mod a complicated research system, the purpose of which is to prevent fast and chaotic advancement through technology branches.

The main change is the requirement for research resources.
If earlier, it was enough for you to put up a research table, now you will still need resources that depend on research.
So, for example, for research
{Hyperlink(def="SimpleWoodProcessing", defType="ResearchProjectDef")}

You need a tree. Agree, to learn how to process a tree without ever holding it in your hands?

To find out the requirement for research, just hover over it in the research menu.
{Image(path="Core/Tutorials/ResearchSystem/1", size="(268, 254)")}

In order for your colonists to explore and bring resources, you need to build
{Hyperlink(def="Research_ResourceBox", defType="ThingDef")}

It needs to be positioned so that it connects to the research tables:
{Image(path="Core/Tutorials/ResearchSystem/2", size="(530, 520)")}

When choosing a study and with the availability of resources, your colonists will automatically fill it out, and as soon as there are enough resources for the study, they will begin to explore.

Remember that modifying a research in progress will destroy some of the resources according to the formula: number_of_item * percentage_of_research_completed.
So, if a research requires, for example, 100 wood, and you cancel a research that is 80% complete, then you will get 20 wood, i.e. 100 * 0.8 = 20.
