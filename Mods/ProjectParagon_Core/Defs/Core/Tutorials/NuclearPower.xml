ЯNuclear reactors can produce huge amounts of energy. How to build them?


In addition to regular technologies, nuclear reactors require special research, which can be done at a separate research table. These are various stages of preparation and testing.

How does a reactor work? It converts water into steam, which is used to spin a turbine. Therefore, you will need a huge amount of water.
The water is converted into ultra-high pressure steam, which is used to rotate the first stage turbine. Next, the steam is converted into high-pressure steam, which is used to rotate the second stage turbine.

Do not allow the core to overheat, as this can lead to an explosion.
