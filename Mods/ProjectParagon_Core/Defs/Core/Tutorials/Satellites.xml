Satellites are an expensive but spectacular demonstration of the power of science, but why are they needed?


To further advance in technology, you will need to get space data points, which can be obtained using satellites.
In addition, companions provide useful bonuses for your settlement.


First you need to build the Novax center, which is the command center for all your satellites in orbit.

To build a simple satellite, you will need only a few elements:
{Image(path="Core/Tutorials/Satellites/1", size="(510, 510)")}
{Hyperlink(def="SatelliteBeam", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="SatelliteEngine", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="SatelliteSensorCluster", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="SatelliteSolarGenerator", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="SatelliteComputerCore", defType="ThingDef")}


This satellite is quite useless, but it will give you information about all the settlements on the map.


To receive space data, you need to build a satellite containing storage and living modules.
Place your scientists inside, fill the storage facilities with food and hard drives, and command takeoff. Your scientists will explore space in orbit, landing home once their food supply is depleted.
All that remains is to decrypt the received data using computing power.

{Hyperlink(def="SatelliteStorage", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="SatelliteCapsule", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="SpaceDataHDD", defType="ThingDef")}
{Hyperlink(def="SpacePaste", defType="ThingDef")}
