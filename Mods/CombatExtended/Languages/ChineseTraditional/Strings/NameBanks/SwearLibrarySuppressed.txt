Suckers! No regard for human life!
I'm gonna get my ass kicked!
Line up you fools!
Allah-Akbar!
We will never surrender!
And mommy told me there were no monsters!
This is gonna hurt!
That's not what I signed up for!
I'll shove my foot so far up your ass, you gon' choke on my laces!
I should have stayed home!
I am so mad!
A little more lead and I'll turn into a statue!
That was my favourite eye!
Just wait and I will be dancing on your grave!
Aren't YOU a piece of cake? Let me stick a fork in you!
Oh boy! He actually hit me!
I might have lost a lung....
I'm cool! Don't hit me!
You broke my wank-hand you bastard!
Don't kick me!
Can't you train on someone else first?
I_am_fucked.exe initiated...
I need a change of underwear!
One, two, three...am I still alive? Four, five
I hope that's not my spleen there on the floor
Some one get a first aid kit! Or a joint
This is screwed up!
Screw you asshole!
Get your filthy paws off of me!
Well, fuck me!
Bitch you just bought a ticket to hell!
Oh! Look how much blood....I had.
My eye! My precious eye!
Dammit!
Just you wait, I'll give it to you smooth and hard!
It's time to study the enemy from afar!
You're gonna pay..oh how you're gonna pay!
They are CRAZY!
Its easier to be brave from a distance!
My sheesh, my sheesh!
Have they lost their minds?!
Oh, you scum!
And then? And then I died..haha. My favourite joke!
Come to the door...and you gonna pick your bones off the floor!
Hello to you too!
If you can't listen , you're gonna have to feel!
He that will not hear must feel.
Ey..guys, hurry!
Step on up ladies and gents!
Dont anger the angry white people!
Do you even know who I am?!
Don't hit me, I'm a certified idiot!
People aren't afraid of dying but of loosing their life!
Please don't think I'm just to lazy to carry you myself!
What's that smell?! Oh..that's us.
We swear we're fun guys!
Do I look like I'm greenpeace you vermin?
Better to get a bit wet than get a lot dead.
Don't touch me!
Did I explain to you already, what crazy means?
This ain't at all like taking candy from a baby!
You're to late! The beer is already all gone!
I was an adventurer..then I took an arrow to the knee
Aaaahhhhhh-aaaaaaaahhhh!
We fight or we die!
No retreat, no surrender!
Kill or be killed!
Don't forget: the pin, you pull and the grenade is what you throw!
Does he even realize he's off his meds?!
Stupid bastards! Just went ahead and burned my farm!
Where will my blood spill?
Stay back you vile scum!
Oh pleasant fear, oh sweet despair!
I hope you all croak!
I'm not afraid of anything! Aaaahhh!
Madness will consume you!
This. Is. SPARTAAAA!
I'm still kicking!
All is not lost yet!
Maybe we will die, but at least we have our freedom!
I will rip out your guts, you bastards!
The real war will start tomorrow, with a hangover!
But we used to get along so well!
I hate inept raiders
Mrrrmrrrgml!
Mrgl mrrrgll?
Arrggghhhh! Arrgh aaahhhhh!
