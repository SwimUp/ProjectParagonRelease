    <priority>11</priority>
    <helpText>The animal handling skill of a Pawn affects how effective it can use mounts. Per level that the skill is below the level needed to tame an animal, a penalty for movement (2%) and accuracy (0.5%) is applied for each level. If the skill level is above the needed level to tame the animal, an equal bonus is applied. The per-level bonuses/penalties can be configured in the mod settings. </helpText>
