<description>LWM's Fuel Filter

LWM's Fuel Filter allows you to choose which possible fuels will actually get used when refueling.

"Hey, what do you have there in your arms?"

        "A big pile of Thrumbone - it's a super expensive bone from a neat mod!"

"Really expensive, eh?"

        "Yeah!  Hard to get - we barely have any and it's great stuff - you can use it like wood!"

"I notice you're walking towards the Blast Furnace. Where are you taking it?"

        "Oh, I'm going to burn it all as fuel."

"Don't we have a lot of really cheap wood?"

        "Yeah, but this was closer!"

"..."

As a bonus, I patch anything that burns "WoodLog" (that is, wood) to burn "Woody" things (only helps if you have mods that add woody things, such as Lulu's bone mod, or some of the expanded biome mods...but unless you have a mod like that, you probably don't need this anyway!)  So the Blast Furnace from Project RimFactory can burn the sequoia wood from expanded biomes.  If a similar patch is needed for metals, I can do that too.

Enjoy, --LWM
