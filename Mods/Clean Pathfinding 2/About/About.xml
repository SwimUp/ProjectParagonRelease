	<description>When pathfinding costs are calculated, any terrain tiles that generate filth are taken into account and given some degree of avoidance. Also, roads can be given a bonus attraction, and the overall pathfinding range can be adjusted. Other features such as light attraction and extra range can also be enabled.</description>
