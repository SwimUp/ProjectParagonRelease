	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.Bias>Dirty terrain avoidance (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): </CleanPathfinding.Settings.Bias>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.Bias.Desc>Extra perceived pathcost to apply to filth-generating terrain tiles.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.Bias.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.NaturalBias>Clean stone terrain avoidance (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): </CleanPathfinding.Settings.NaturalBias>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.NaturalBias.Desc>Since stone terrain does not generate filth, the above setting may cause pawns be overly attracted to walking upon it, depending on the map layout. You can tinker with this setting if you're trying to avoid this behavior.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.NaturalBias.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.RoadBias>Road attraction (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): </CleanPathfinding.Settings.RoadBias>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.RoadBias.Desc>A reduction of perceived pathcost for any tiles with the "Road" tag.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.RoadBias.Desc>

	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.RegionModeThreshold>Region pathing threshold (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): </CleanPathfinding.Settings.RegionModeThreshold>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.RegionModeThreshold.Desc>if a pawn's pathfinder calculates a number of cells beyond this threshold, they switch to "regional pathfinding mode", which causes their calculations to chunk out into 12x12 blocks. This is more expensive, but can broaden their search to allow them to discover things such as roads to aid calculating the best path. This option may be ideal for players whom are dillgent about building out pathing infrastructure.\n\nIf you decrease this threshold, consider lowering heuristic tuning, or turning it off entirely</CleanPathfinding.Settings.RegionModeThreshold.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableTuning>Enable tuning</CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableTuning>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableTuning.Desc>Turning this off returns pathfinding to normal vanilla behavior.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableTuning.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.DarknessPenalty>Darkness penalty (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): </CleanPathfinding.Settings.DarknessPenalty>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.DarknessPenalty.Desc>Sets the extra cost to add to dark tiles.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.DarknessPenalty.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorLight>Pathfinding should factor light</CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorLight>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorLight.Desc>Pawns will factor and bias lit paths. This extra calculation has a small performance impact.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorLight.Desc>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.HeuristicAdjuster>Heuristic tuning (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): {3}</CleanPathfinding.Settings.HeuristicAdjuster>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.HeuristicAdjuster.Desc>A higher value will cause the calculations to "bloom out" like a cone based on how far away the destination is. When maxed out, a brute-force degree of cells are analyzed for maximum precision at the cost of performance.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.HeuristicAdjuster.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorCarryingPawn>Pawns ignore rules if carrying another pawn</CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorCarryingPawn>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorCarryingPawn.Desc>Pawns will ignore rules if they're carrying another pawn.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorCarryingPawn.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorBleeding>Pawns ignore rules if bleeding</CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorBleeding>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorBleeding.Desc>Pawns will ignore rules if they're bleeding more than 10%/d.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.FactorBleeding.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableExitTuning>Enable exitfinding</CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableExitTuning>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.ExitRange.Warning>Only use exit tuning if you play on an unusual map and notice pawns getting stuck trying to find the map exit. Enabling/disabling this requires a restart.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.ExitRange.Warning>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.ExitRange>Exit range (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): </CleanPathfinding.Settings.ExitRange>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.ExitRange.Desc>Pawns look around them for an exit, each time looking +4 tiles farther and farther out. In vanilla they give up after 30 iterations. This slider increases the number of iterations to make their exit finding more aggressive.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.ExitRange.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableWanderTuning>Enable wander tuning</CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableWanderTuning>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableWanderTuning.Desc>Allows adjustments to pawns and animals that wander around aimlessly.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.EnableWanderTuning.Desc>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.WanderDelay>Wander delay (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}) {3}</CleanPathfinding.Settings.WanderDelay>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.WanderDelay.Desc>Adds a number of extra seconds before a pawn (including penned animals and wildlife) wanders to a new nearby spot. Increase this for a minor aid to performance at the cost of a less lively world.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.WanderDelay.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathing>Enable doorpathing</CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathing>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathing.Desc>Disabling this will remove the pathing priority gizmos given to doors.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathing.Desc>

	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathingSide.Desc>Pawns will consider this extra pathing cost when going through doors marked as side doors. For consideration, by default a normal door is considered +45 cost.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathingSide.Desc>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathingEmergency>Emergency door pathcost (Mod default: {0}, Min: {1}, Max: {2}): </CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathingEmergency>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathingEmergency.Desc>Pawns will consider this extra pathing cost when going through doors marked as emergency doors. For consideration, by default a normal door is considered +45 cost.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.DoorPathingEmergency.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.OptimizeCollider>Optimize collider check</CleanPathfinding.Settings.OptimizeCollider>
	<CleanPathfinding.Settings.OptimizeCollider.Desc>Replace the code that checks if pawns should collide with other pawns with an optimized version. No logic change. This optimization is automatically disabled if it detects another mod needs to modify this code and it would conflict. Changing this requires a restart.</CleanPathfinding.Settings.OptimizeCollider.Desc>
	
	<CleanPathfinding.Icon.DoorType.Desc>Change the door type to alter routing behavior.\n\nColonist pawns resist going through side doors, and even more so emergency doors.\n\nExclusive doors are meant for rooms with no other way in, providing a routing hint.</CleanPathfinding.Icon.DoorType.Desc>
