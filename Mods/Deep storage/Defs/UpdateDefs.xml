		<content>Weapon Locker Defs have changed.  If you had a Weapons Locker in your game, *you will get errors*; this is okay.  The locker will be destroyed, but *all your weapons are okay*!  You can either have your pawns rebuild the locker (maybe the first one broke), or use dev-mode's god-mode to replace it.

Sorry about that; I did not plan ahead well enough when merging someone else's work.  Shouldn't happen again.

Also, new mod option: you can allow your animals (robots, etc) to carry to deep storage too, if you really want!

Enjoy!  -LWM</content>
