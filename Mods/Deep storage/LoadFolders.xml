  <!-- For the record, I think the way fallback versions are handled by RW
       are kinda dumb.....if I have an assembly in 1.1 and one in 1.3, but
       the user is on 1.2.....why would the game try the 1.3 folder before
       trying the 1.1 folder (which presumably works, otherwise the author
       would have made a 1.2 folder.....)  Grr.  /rant-->
  <!-- Rant the 2nd.  Why are the default folders "1.1", "1.2", etc,
       but the loadFolders structure requres "v1.1", "v1.2", etc???? -->
  <v1.1>
    <li>/</li>
    <li>1.1</li><!--Might even still work-->
  </v1.1>
  <v1.2>
    <li>/</li>
    <li>1.1</li><!--definitely still works!-->
  </v1.2>
  <v1.3>
    <li>/</li>
    <li>1.3</li>
