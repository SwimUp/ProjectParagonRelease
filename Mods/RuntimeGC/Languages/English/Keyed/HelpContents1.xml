	<HelpTextGCWP>CleanUp : World Pawns


When disappeared from a map(eg. walk to the edge and leave),a pawn would be stored as a World Pawn.It is the same with dead pawns.

The WorldPawns pool is designed to hold important pawns(faction leaders, members of your caravan,dead relatives,etc.) and to make the relation network more realistic(relatives are selected and spawned from it sometimes).

But you won't mind removing useless ones to make your game run as smoothly as it used to...or 24fps at least,will you?



-Removes all unnecessary World Pawns to alleviate burden of GameSystem

-Keeps all faction leaders

-Keeps all pawns existing in a map

-Keeps all relatives(alive or dead) of your colonists or prisoners

-Keeps all pawns traveling in world map(caravans,transport pods...)

-All tales used by artworks will be kept,but some(a small proportion of) unused tales will be deleted

And many patches are imported to avoid potential bugs,just feel free to do this cleaning!



PS. The longer you play(in-game time),the more effective this cleaning will be.</HelpTextGCWP>
